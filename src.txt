==Description==
Chase uses skills in conjunction with four animals - a [[Beast Tamer/Skills#Bear Skills|bear]], [[Beast Tamer/Skills#Snow Leopard Skills|leopard]], [[Beast Tamer/Skills#Hawk Skills|hawk]] and [[Beast Tamer/Skills#Cat Skills|cat]], all of which are cycled through [[Critter Select]]. The bear uses mainly strong melee skills, the leopard uses fast attacks over wide areas, the hawk uses aerial skills and provides many enhancements to speed, and the cat uses a variety of buffs.

Similar to [[Zero]], Chase lacks any job advancement and only unlocks skills by not only leveling up, but also distributing points throughout the four animal skill trees. But unlike Zero, all the skill trees do not gain their own separate SP; only 3 SP is given per level up and must be distributed across all the trees.
